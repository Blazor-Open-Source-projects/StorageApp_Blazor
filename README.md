A Storage App
<p>There are 3 pages:
ItemList, AddItem, and UpdateItem.
Its an app to people can come and write about their Storage items price, quantity and some other information about it.
That's how they can know what they have in their storage what is it's worth without go and check every single time
And that's how they will not need to write on any paper anything everything if there is any update or a new item they will be easly handle it,
It's quite usefull for people who is always need to check what they have in case of any order or any other need.
